Project : Inventory tracker

Project Overview : This project will simulate an Inventory tracker on store with some problems such as shortage or Overflow

Implementation of std::map 
The map's key (std::string) will represent the store's branch name
The value (std::array<std::list<std::string>, 3>) will represent the store's inventory

ex)array[0]: A list of Juice (e.g., Orange juice, Apple juice)

This simulation will have a one month time period to run 

The program starts as it reads the txt file that has initial stock info

for events, there will be standard sale, restock, and speical events such as disaster, shortage or Overflow
